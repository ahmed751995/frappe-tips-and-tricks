#+TITLE: Javascript-scripts Tips and Tricks

i will divide this file into four(until now!) parts General, Form, Child Table, List.

- General: which you can use any where either in form or list.
- Form: scripts you can use only in the form itself.
- Child Table: scripts which can be used in form but on child Table in this form.
- List: in the doc list

(*Hint!*) i won't write any solution already written in frappe documentations
